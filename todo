# TODO List for Netflix Automation Project

## API Endpoints to Implement

1. **Endpoint for Active Sessions**
   - Create an endpoint to retrieve all active sessions
   - Should return a list of current sessions with details like session ID, status, and creation time

2. **Snapshot Management Endpoints**
   - Endpoint to delete a specific subfolder from the snapshot directory
   - Endpoint to delete all subfolders from the snapshot directory
   - Endpoint to delete a specific subfolder from the container's snapshot directory
   - Endpoint to delete all subfolders from the container's snapshot directory

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure endpoints handle permissions and security
- Add logging for audit trails
- Consider adding rate limiting for deletion operations

## Payment Flow Enhancements
3. **Payment Click Handling**
   - After clicking payment, if no redirection to next page occurs, take 3 screenshots with 5-second intervals between each capture
   - Implement logic to detect if redirection happens within expected timeframe
   - Save screenshots for debugging purposes

4. **Continue Button Handling**
   - After clicking a continue/next button, if the page does not change, wait 5 seconds and retry the click up to 3 times
   - If the page still does not change after 3 retries, flag as error, send error message, and capture error snapshot
